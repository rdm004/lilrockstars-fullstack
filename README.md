# Lil Rockstars Racing 🏎️

**Building Champions One Lap at a Time!**

Founded in 2023, the Lil Rockstars Juicebox / Snackpack Series began as part of the original Juicebox division in Florida before establishing its roots in Fayetteville, NC.

Our journey began with just 25 drivers at our first race. Today, we’re proud to have grown to over 85 racers between the ages of 3 and 7!

This series is about more than just racing — we believe that “God is #1”, no matter where we finish on the track. We value family, friendships, and celebrating every victory — big or small.

🏆 **Mission:** Build Champions One Lap at a Time!
